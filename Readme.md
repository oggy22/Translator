Translator from and to natural languages
==============================================
Translator supports **Serbian and English** so far.
Planned support includes Russian, German and Spanish.
Other languages that might be implemented in the future are Macedonian, Serbian latin/Croatian, and some Polish and French.

So far I have some limited success to parse some simple Serbian and English sentences.

Palindromes for Serbian languages
==============================================
A submodule of the program can generate palindromes in Serbian language to a certain lenght.
